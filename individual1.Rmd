# The histogram seems to be unimodal and the shape of the histogram seems to be bellshaped or one could argue that it is a little skewed to the left. 

correlationChoco <-cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)

ggplot(choco, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating)) +
  geom_point()

# Looking at our statistics and plot, I believe there is very weak correlation between Cocoa.Pct and Rating.  So I would say no, the ratings do not depend on the cacao percentage.
